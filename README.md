# Setup

Make sure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3
- WSL's Ubuntu (Or some other Linux distro)
- You can run virtual enviroments

**NOTE**
We created a local package for installation because one of our packages
was too large to upload to PyPi because they have a 60 mb limit


1. git clone https://github.com/GaboxFH/cis4930-django-findcar-pkg.git

2. cd into the project directory then install the package: pip install dist/django-findcar-0.0.10.tar.gz

3. In command line run 'runmyserver'

4. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in a browser.

Page should render, let me know in Teams if you run into any issues.
